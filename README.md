# Welcome to John Muller's Github.io page

For now I am using this to point to a few  of my github repos that have some ML/Data Science projects
that hopefully show a variety of skills.

I hope to keep adding to these with things like: more deep learning, NLP, and much more.

For now I will list 3 recent projects.

## Recent Data Science projects


* Classification, in particular stroke prediction.  In the project I compare
results using logistic regression, Gradient Boosting and Random Forests.  
The project also gave me a chance to try out some hyper parameter tuning.  
To see the code, Open the notebook ***stroke.ipynb***  
from the repo https://github.com/jhmuller/stroke/

• Simple Image Classification.   
 I use tensorflow and Keras to try to distinguish
between 2 kids of flowers.  
 I did manual tuning of the hyper parameters such as layers, dropout and learning rate.   
I'll soon have to learn to use tools like keras tune like I did the tools with sklearn.  
To see the code, open the notebook ***flowers.ipynb***   
 from the repo https://github.com/jhmuller/flowers/

• Time Series Exploratory data analysys on energy price data from the Texax grid Ercot.  
I had done time series EDA and some modeling with R, but this gave me a chance
to try doing the same with Python tools.  
To see the code, open the notebook ***timeseries.ipynb*** 
 from the repo https://github.com/jhmuller/timeseries
