# Welcome to John Muller's Github.io page

Sorry to redirect you, but go [here](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/jhmuller/jhmuller.github.io/blob/main///index.html) for a nicer HTML page with links to older projects.   

In addition, below are some links to my HuggingFace spaces with some recent work.  


[summarize](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jmuller/summariza) is an app to summarize NPR news stories.  


[complain](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jmuller/complaint_letter) is an app to generate a letter complaing to an airline customer service department about issues on a recent flight.
