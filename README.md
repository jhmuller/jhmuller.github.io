# Welcome to John Muller's Github.io page

For now I am using this to point to a few  
of my github repos that have some recent ML/Data Science projects.

I hope to keep adding to these with things like
* deep learning
* NLP
* causal models
* and much more

For now I will list 3 recent projects.

## Recent Data Science projects

* Classification, in particular stroke prediction.  In the project I compare
results using logistic regression, Gradient Boosting and Random Forests.
To see the code, Open the notebook <em>stroke.ipynb>/em>   
from the repo https://github.com/jhmuller/stroke/

• Simple Image Classification.  I use tensorflow and Keras to try to distinguish
between 2 kids of flowers.  
To see the code, open the notebook ***flowers.ipynb***  
 from the repo https://github.com/jhmuller/flowers/

• Time Series Exploratory data analysys on energy price data from the Texax grid Ercot.  
Open the notebook ***timeseries.ipynb*** 
 from the repo https://github.com/jhmuller/timeseries
