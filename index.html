<h1 id="welcome-to-john-muller-s-github-io-page">Welcome to John Muller&#39;s Github.io page</h1>
<p>I am using this site to list pointers to a few  of my github repos
that have some ML/Data Science projects that hopefully show a variety of skills.</p>
<p>I use Jupyter notebooks for all of the projects.  I realize that in production
you are more likely to use Python scripts.  In fact, my style of development
is often to use both, migrating mature code
from a Notebook to functions and classes in a Python script.
However, the Notebooks offers the wonderful ability to embed
markdown with the code and I think that is a great asset for what
I am trying to achieve here.</p>
<h2 id="sample-of-data-science-projects">Sample of Data Science projects</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Comparison of Classification Methods</strong><br>The data is from Kaggle and on stroke patients.
It has attributes and an outcome variable of stroke or not.
In the project I am interested in how 3 models compare in accuracy:
  logistic regression, Gradient Boosting and Random Forests.<br>The project also gave me a chance to use some hyper parameter tuning in sklearn.  The code and output can be found  <a href="https://github.com/jhmuller/stroke/blob/main/stroke.html">here</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Image Classification</strong><br>I use tensorflow and Keras to try to distinguish between 2 kids of flowers.
While a fairly simple task, it&#39;s not my first image
classification project,  but one of the first where I tried a lot of tuning.
I did manual tuning of the hyper parameters such as layers, dropout and learning rate.
It&#39;s clear I am going to have to start using tools like Keras tune or
something equivalent in PyTorch.<br>The code and output can be found 
<a href="https://github.com/jhmuller/flowers/blob/master/flowers.html"> here</a></p>
</li>

<li><p><strong>Text Classification</strong><br>This is another Kaggle data set although originally from Reddit.
It is posts labeled as &quot;depression related&quot; or not.
I modeled my solution after some code from a Coursera class that uses tensorflow.<br>The code and ouptupt can be found here 
<a href="https://github.com/jhmuller/text_classify/blob/master/text_classify.html">here </a></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Embeddings for recommendations</strong><br>In this project I use a movie rating dataset and derive embedddings
for users and movies that can be used to derive a predicted
rating of the movie by the user.  To get the prediction we take
the dot product of the movie and user embeddings.
The embeddings are &quot;learned&quot; by training a neural network using Pytorch.
Note that there are many more sophisticated ways to do recommendations including
the Two Tower Model and now TorchRec.  However, this fairly simple Method
seemed like a good place to start.<br>The code and output can be found  <a href="https://github.com/jhmuller/recs/blob/master/recs.html">here</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Text generation</strong><br>Chat bots and translation are a few examples of applications
of generating new text from some seed or starter text.
You can even play around with using it on your own starter
text at the Hugging Face website.
I wanted to get started with some of the Hugging face APIs AND I was
curious about text generation so I devised an experiment.
In particular, I was curious what would get generated if the<br>seed were for example: famous book beginnings, movie quotes, jokes,
and other oddball starter strings.<br>So I created a Jupyter notebook to try it out.<br>
The code and output can be found <a href="https://github.com/jhmuller/text_gen/blob/master/text_gen.html">here</a></p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clustering time series.</strong><br>I found some interesting time series data on electricity cost
at the state/month level.  Too coarse for energy trading
but maybe useful to understand macro trends in prices.
I used Kmeans to cluster the series.  The resulting
clusters were interesting and I think I could tell a story
for most of the results.
The code and output can be found <a href="https://html-preview.github.io?url=https://github.com/jhmuller/energy_price/blob/main/energy_clusters.html">here</a>   </h1>
